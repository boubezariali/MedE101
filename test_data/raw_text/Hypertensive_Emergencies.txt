BP is elevated, often markedly (diastolic pressure > 120 mm Hg). CNS symptoms include rapidly
changing neurologic abnormalities (eg, confusion, transient cortical blindness, hemiparesis, hemisensory
defects, seizures). Cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain and dyspnea. Renal involvement may be
asymptomatic, although severe azotemia due to advanced renal failure may cause lethargy or nausea.
Physical examination focuses on target organs, with neurologic examination, funduscopy, and
cardiovascular examination. Global cerebral deficits (eg, confusion, obtundation, coma), with or without
focal deficits, suggest encephalopathy; normal mental status with focal deficits suggests stroke. Severe
retinopathy (sclerosis, cotton-wool spots, arteriolar narrowing, hemorrhage, papilledema) is usually
present with hypertensive encephalopathy, and some degree of retinopathy is present in many other
hypertensive emergencies. Jugular venous distention, basilar lung crackles, and a 3rd heart sound
suggest pulmonary edema. Asymmetry of pulses between arms suggests aortic dissection.
