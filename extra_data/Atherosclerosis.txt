Atherosclerosis is initially asymptomatic, often for decades. Symptoms and signs develop when lesions
impede blood flow. Transient ischemic symptoms (eg, stable exertional angina, transient ischemic attacks,
intermittent claudication) may develop when stable plaques grow and reduce the arterial lumen by > 70%.
Symptoms of unstable angina or infarction, ischemic stroke, or rest pain in the limbs may develop when
unstable plaques rupture and acutely occlude a major artery, with superimposition of thrombosis or
embolism. Atherosclerosis may also cause sudden death without preceding stable or unstable angina
pectoris.
Atherosclerotic involvement of the arterial wall can lead to aneurysms and arterial dissection, which can
manifest as pain, a pulsatile mass, absent pulses, or sudden death.
