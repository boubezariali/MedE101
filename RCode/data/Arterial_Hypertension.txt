Hypertension is usually asymptomatic until complications develop in target organs. Dizziness, flushed
facies, headache, fatigue, epistaxis, and nervousness are not caused by uncomplicated hypertension.
Severe hypertension (hypertensive emergenciesâ€”see p. 2078) can cause severe cardiovascular,
neurologic, renal, and retinal symptoms (eg, symptomatic coronary atherosclerosis, HF, hypertensive
encephalopathy, renal failure).
A 4th heart sound is one of the earliest signs of hypertensive heart disease.
Retinal changes may include arteriolar narrowing, hemorrhages, exudates, and, in patients with
encephalopathy, papilledema (see p. 616). Changes are classified (according to the Keith, Wagener, and
Barker classification) into 4 groups with increasingly worse prognosis: constriction of arterioles only
(grade 1), constriction and sclerosis of arterioles (grade 2), hemorrhages and exudates in addition to
vascular changes (grade 3), and papilledema (grade 4).
